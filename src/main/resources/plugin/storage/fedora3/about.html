    <p>This plugin provides storage using version 3.5 of the
        <a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/">Fedora Commons</a> Client.
        It has been tested against v3.5, v3.3.1 and v2.2.4 Fedora servers,
        but will probably support others as well.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> This plugin is only supported on Linux, Mac OS X and
        Windows Server platforms. Windows client and workstation platforms are
        not supported due to restrictions commonly imposed on concurrent network
        connections by non-server Windows licenses.</p>
